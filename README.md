# Light version of ESP32 BLE

This is a fork of the official esp32 ble library and is stripped to decrease the size. It is only possible to use the ble server features.

I saved about ~30KB program size with this version.

The repository of the original library is here: https://github.com/nkolban/ESP32_BLE_Arduino
